<h3>Software Collections 1.0 is designed for developers seeking access to cutting-edge progamming tools with support.</h3>
<p>Red Hat has put out a beta release of Software Collections 1.0, in a bid to let developers use newer versions of languages such as Ruby and Python with support.<br>
For certain applications, a more recent version of a language than what's included in the base Enterprise Linux (RHEL) system is needed, according to Red Hat. Software Collections 1.0 is the first in a series of releases designed to allow developers to take advantage of new capabilities in their Web apps faster with the safety net of support from Red Hat, it said.</p>
